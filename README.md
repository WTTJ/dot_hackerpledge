The Hacker Pledge v1.0
======================

The Hacker Pledge is a public commitment from a company to provide a hacker-friendly workplace for its employees so they can thrive and continue improving their skills, to their common benefit.


The pledge
==========

As a company, we pledge to support:

 1. **Initiative & curiosity**

  We expect hackers to be creative, contribute product ideas, and challenge the status quo. We encourage them to read tech news, explore new software, and attend a few events a year on work time to keep their skills up-to-date.

 2. **High-productivity working conditions**

  We let hackers choose the best tools available, both software and hardware. To avoid interrupts and foster high-quality work, we provide an environment as calm and stress-free as possible.

 3. **Openness & freedom of speech**

  We encourage our staff to share ideas and knowledge about technology through meetups and exchanges with other hackers, while respecting the company's expectations for confidentiality.

 4. **Giving back to the community**

  Given how essential Free Software is to a hacker's work, we strive to give back by contributing upstream, open-sourcing internal projects, and sponsoring conferences or community organizations.

How to contribute
=================

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions directly on GitHub as Pull Requests on the README.md file. Please explain the rationale behind your ideas a bit more than you would for a regular PR though ;)

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

We will get a panel of highly respected hackers to act as moral authority in case of unresolved debates.
