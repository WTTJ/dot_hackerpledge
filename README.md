The Hacker Pledge v0.2
======================

This document is a list of pledges that a company is willing to make to its engineers so they can thrive and continue developing their skills, to their common benefit.

This is a living, versioned, document based on a broad consensus from a community of hackers. We believe not only taking the pledge but also following its principles will help your technical team be happy and do the best work they can.


Our pledge
===========

 1. **Curiosity & initiative**

  We want hackers to contribute product ideas and challenge the status quo, as technology moves fast we make sure they have time to read tech news and explore new software. We consider these activities to be working time. 

 2. **High-productivity working conditions**

  We support a hacker's ability to choose the best tools available, both software and hardware. We know interuptions to be harmful to productivity, we try to provide as quiet and as stress-free environment as possible.

 3. **Openness & freedom of speech**

  Some of the aspects of our company are secret, we expect our employees to respect that, beyond those we encourage our staff to share ideas about technology through meetups and exchanges with other hackers. We do not block IRC.

 4. **Giving back to the community**

  Free Software is often critical to a hacker's ability to do his job, we strive to give back by contributing upstream, open-sourcing internal projects and sponsoring meetups, community organizations or conferences.


F.A.Q
=====

**Does this pledge have legal status?**

No. Still, it represents a strong, public commitment towards a hacker-friendly culture in the workplace.

**What is the value of this pledge?**

Supporting this pledge means two things for a company:
 * it shares most of the values of the hacker community.
 * it is actually capable of coming out publicly to support them. Most large companies sunk in bureaucracy wouldn't be able to.

**As a company, how do I support the pledge?**

We will announce an "official" protocol to publicly support the pledge, with a directory of companies having done so. It will probably consist of a tweet sent from the official company account and possibly a badge.

In the meantime, please contact us at contact@dotconferences.eu to be among the launch companies.

**As a hacker, how do I support the pledge?**

About the same. We should work on a good wording for a tweet to show support, something like "I would strongly prefer working in a company supporting the Hacker Pledge".

**Why did you create this pledge?**

As conference organizers (http://dotconferences.eu), we often see cases where companies are not educated towards the benefits of rewarding curiosity, initiative and openness of their engineers. We think it is mutually beneficial to have a hacker-friendly workplace and we hope to set a baseline for what this actually means.

**Shouldn't inclusiveness and non-discrimination be part of the pledge?**

Everyone (not just hackers!) should be treated without discrimination regarding gender, ethnic minority or beliefs. This pledge only covers hacker-specific points.

**Why don't you mention comfortable chairs?**

Same reason. The health of a hacker is not more valuable than any other employee.

How to contribute
=================

This is a community-driven project, and we welcome all contributions directly on GitHub as Pull Requests. Please explain the rationale behind your ideas a bit more than you would for a regular PR though ;)

(Contributions on wording & style are also welcome.)

We will get a panel of highly respected hackers to act as moral authority in case of unresolved debates.
